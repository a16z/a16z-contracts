Ti=“CAN’T BE EVIL” NFT LICENSE<br>EXCLUSIVE COMMERCIAL RIGHTS WITH NO CREATOR RETENTION (“CBE-ECR”)

Law.State.the=the State of New York

PeriodForAmicableDisputeResolution.days=ninety (90) days

Note=Parameterizing, deduplicating and assuring consistency of the phrase that describes affiliates of i) Creator and ii) Project NFT owner. (Just and example of reusing phrases.  Another, more lawyerly approach would be to define "Affiliates."  But this makes the word2vec point in another example.)

Grant.Derivative.TolerateOther.1.Intro.sec=These {_Other_NFT_Media_Derivatives} may be similar or identical to {_Your_NFT_Media_Derivatives}. Accordingly, on behalf of yourself and your heirs, successors and assigns, you irrevocably covenant and agree not to assert or bring any suit, claim, demand or challenge against

Grant.Transfer.BlockchainFork.sec=Because virtually all public blockchains are licensed under open source licenses, it is possible that the blockchain may fork, merge, or duplicate the original blockchain that initially recorded ownership of your {_Project_NFT}.

Grant.Transfer.BlockchainRecording.sec=In such case, any rights granted under these {_Terms} to owners of any {_Project_NFT} will only be granted to the lawful owners of such {_Project_NFT} whose ownership is recorded on the mainnet version of the blockchain that is generally recognized and predominantly supported in the blockchain industry as the legitimate successor of the original blockchain (as determined in our sole discretion).
