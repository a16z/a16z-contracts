EXHIBIT 4“CAN’T BE EVIL” NFT LICENSEPERSONAL LICENSE (“CBE-PERSONAL”)By acquiring lawful ownership to a non-fungible token (“NFT”) associated with the NFT project made available under this NFT License (“Project NFT”) created by the owner or entity that has created this Project NFT (“Creator” or “we” or “our”), you agree to these NFT License Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”).  When you lawfully own a Project NFT, you own all personal property rights to the NFT underlying the Project NFT (e.g., the right to freely sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of that Project NFT).  However, your rights to the associated artwork, images, video, content or other works of authorship linked to your specific Project NFT which was developed by Creator (“NFT Media”) are only as outlined below.  1. NFT LICENSE GRANT1.1 1.1 NFT Media License.  For as long as you lawfully own a Project NFT, Creator grants you a non- exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable (except as set forth in Section 3.2 below)] worldwide license under our copyrights to use, distribute, reproduce, display, and perform (but not modify) the specific NFT Media linked to your Project NFT for personal non-commercial uses, with the right to sublicense such rights solely to third parties to enable the right to display the NFT Media, with Creator being a third party beneficiary to all such sublicenses with the ability to enforce such agreements.  This license includes the right to display NFT Media as a profile picture.  All intellectual property rights in and to the NFT Media and any other intellectual property rights of Creator not expressly licensed herein are reserved by Creator.  1.2 Reserved.1.3 No Rights to Trademarks.  Nothing in these Terms is meant to grant you any rights to any logos, trademarks, service marks, and trade dress associated with Creator or the Project NFTs (“Project Trademarks”).  Unless you have our prior written approval, you may not use any Project Trademarks for any use that would require a license from us, including to register any domain names or social media accounts using any Project Trademarks or to advertise or promote any other products or services.   1.4 Transfer and Sublicensing.  The licenses granted in these Terms are non-transferrable, except that if you lawfully transfer ownership of your Project NFT, the license to the NFT Media in Section 1.1 to you shall terminate upon the effective date of such transfer, and such licenses will be assigned to the new owner of the Project NFT associated with such NFT Media.  As a condition to sales, transfers or similar transactions of the Project NFTs, the transferee agrees upon the acquisition of the Project NFT that (a) the transferee is not a Restricted Party and (b) the transferee accepts these Terms.  Further, if you choose to sublicense any of your licensed rights set forth in Section 1.1 above, you are only permitted to do so if any such sublicensees agree (i) that they are not Restricted Parties and (ii) that if your licensed rights in Section 1.1 are transferred (such as because you sell your Project NFT), then any such sublicenses you have granted in such licensed rights will automatically terminate.  Because virtually all public blockchains are licensed under open source licenses, it is possible that the blockchain may fork, merge, or duplicate the original blockchain that initially recorded ownership of your Project NFT.  In such case, any rights granted under these Terms to owners of any Project NFT will only be granted to the lawful owners of such Project NFT whose ownership is recorded on the mainnet version of the blockchain that is generally recognized and predominantly supported in the blockchain industry as the legitimate successor of the original blockchain (as determined in our sole discretion).1.5 Third Party Content.  The Creator hereby represents and warrants to you that all of the copyrights in the NFT Media are owned by the Creator, and does not contain (a) any artwork, images, video, content or other works of authorship, (b) logos, trademarks, service marks, or trade dress or rights of personality in which the relevant intellectual property rights are not  owned by the Creator (“Third Party Content”), provided that the foregoing shall not apply if the Creator has obtained a license to such Third Party Content consistent with the licenses under this Agreement or the Creator has supplemented this NFT License with an additional license that governs your right to use such Third Party Content.1.6 Restrictions.  If a Project NFT is fractionalized into smaller ownership interests (which may be represented by other tokens), the rights licensed hereunder do not transfer to each of the owners of such fractionalized interests in the Project NFT, but are only granted to those who own all fractionalized interests in a Project NFT or as may otherwise be agreed by the owners of such fractionalized interests if each of such owners agree that  (a) the owner is not a Restricted Party and (b) the owner accepts these Terms.  In order to purchase the Project NFT if you are an individual, you must be 18 years of age or older if the age of lawfully capacity of forming binding contracts is older in the relevant jurisdiction.  If you are an entity, the individual agreeing to the Terms must have the legal authority to bind the entity.  If (a) you are an individual, you agree on your own behalf and (b) if you are an entity, you agree that neither the entity nor any of your owners or investors or any of their directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates acting on your behalf: (i) is related in any way to, the governments of, or any persons within, any country or jurisdiction under a U.S.  embargo enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), or any persons who are named on any list of sanctioned individuals or entities; (ii) is (or has ever been) prohibited from the transaction pursuant to U.S.  anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist, economic sanctions and asset control laws; and (iii) is resident in a country or jurisdiction under a U.S.  embargo enforced by OFAC (“Restricted Parties”).2.
